we're using the Flask web framework to handle incoming webhook requests. The handle_webhook function is called whenever a POST request is made to the /webhook endpoint.

We first check if the request came from an allowed IP address or hostname by comparing the Origin header to a list of allowed origins. If the origin is not in the list, we abort the request with a 403 Forbidden error.

We then verify the payload using the X-Hub-Signature header and the secret key. We compute the expected signature using the secret key and the request data, and compare it to the signature provided in the header. If they don't match, we abort the request with a 401 Unauthorized error.

If the request passes both checks, we can handle the webhook payload as needed and return a 200 OK response to the webhook provider.

Note that this is just a basic example, and you may need to modify it depending on the requirements of your specific use case. For example, you might want to use a more secure hashing algorithm or store the secret key in a more secure manner.

# Requirements
pip install Flask

You may also need to install other dependencies depending on the requirements of your specific use case. For example, if you need to hash the secret key using a different algorithm, you may need to install the hashlib module. Or, if you need to use a different web framework, you may need to install its dependencies as well.

In general, it's a good idea to create a virtual environment for your Python projects to avoid dependency conflicts and keep your environment clean. You can use tools like virtualenv or conda to create virtual environments.
